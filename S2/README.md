# Session 2 - Neural Network Design (BackProp)

## Objective:

Create excel sheet showing backpropagation. Explain each major step with following guidelines. 
- Use exactly the same values for all variables as used in the class
- Take a screenshot, and show that screenshot in the readme file
- Excel file must be there for us to cross-check the image shown on readme (no image = no score)
- Explain each major step
- Show what happens to the error graph when you change the learning rate from [0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 0.8, 1.0, 2.0]
